It is inspired by the danger of cults.</p><p id="fca5d8dc-64f4-4135-9c68-b5194b39dc4b" class="">After posting my story on Reddit, it caught the attention of a CreepyPasta narrator, who translated the story to Spanish and posted a narration of it to his YouTube channel, where it garnered over 54,000 views. The video is embedded at the bottom of this page.</p><p id="780ab5f0-2b32-4407-8e3c-9f55505d4c8c" class="">___________________________________________________________________________________</p><p id="a06a3a75-365b-41ac-bd7d-d1eafb65a42a" class="">Written by Omar Khan.</p><p id="0ada6d34-5bab-4905-965f-4a1a1b74d7d5" class="">
</p><p id="2306bbed-40ac-4d22-af5a-c571c3a7b5ab" class="">My younger sister Cass was only four years old when she began to experience frequent headaches, vomiting, and coordination problems. My mom took her to the doctor and an MRI scan revealed that she had a malignant brain tumour. She underwent a combination of treatments including chemotherapy for over a year, but in the end they all proved to be unsuccessful.</p><p id="04a3da09-0c86-425f-bfc5-39d496849d47" class="">About one year after her diagnosis, the doctors informed us that Cass’s ailment was terminal and that she would likely die in the next four months. My mom and I were devastated. Even as an eleven-year-old, I understood my sister’s fate and dreaded the prospect of living without her.</p><p id="96724827-d13e-4a2f-b5b3-974d93b79d38" class="">My mom had it even harder as she was already in a very fragile emotional state. She had been raising me and Cass alone ever since my dad tragically passed away shortly after Cass was born. Losing two loved ones in such a short span of time can be devastating to a person’s mental well-being. Unfortunately, my mom suffered the full blow. Perhaps this was the reason for her descent into desperation to preserve Cass’s life.</p><p id="1e7dc479-e4f4-4e53-a63d-68fae4883eee" class="">My mom brought Cass home from the hospital and attempted as many ‘alternative’ methods of cancer treatment she could afford. She attempted dietary treatments, hypnosis, acupuncture and countless other methods that were morally suspect to subject a five-year-old to. Of course, none of these treatments were successful.</p><p id="df1c93d6-cf13-4bc7-962e-4cc7c5faba2d" class="">Clearly, my mom was not in the right mind at the time to be caring for a child with terminal cancer. On top of that, she was single and working part-time, so she was crushed by the cost of treatment and medical bills.</p><p id="a7603fb8-141d-48dd-83e5-51a6b7e08d05" class="">Then we received a phone call.</p><p id="3e19a737-eed0-49be-b930-9fcb6f1ba97a" class="">A mysterious person claimed that he could cure Cass of her brain tumour through spiritual healing for free, as long as we were willing to do exactly as he instructed. Desperate and left without any other options, my mom accepted his offer.</p><p id="f983e1d6-6476-4991-aeae-56bbfeebae07" class="">The very next day, we received a package in the mail. It was a box containing about a dozen lemons, several packs of candles, about 1000 dollars, a letter, and what appeared to be a painting of some sort of deity.</p><p id="36c1417c-7698-44f1-a234-a84bf774f742" class="">The letter stated that the deity shown in the painting was Osis. If we followed a set of instructions, Osis would cure Cass of her ailment. The instructions were as follows:</p><ul id="1c306d9b-98f8-4d00-b143-4a5eeaa1635c" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Your house will be lit by only candle light. Turn off all electric lights and devices and never turn them back on. Cover all of the windows with thick curtains in a way that no sunlight penetrates into your house.</li></ul><ul id="7829618f-8253-4f98-aa51-8e6a577eae86" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Place the painting of Osis next to and facing the resting place of your afflicted daughter.</li></ul><ul id="35508b2d-d21f-4d08-9250-5ccee9342767" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Keep a fire burning in your house and throw lemon peels inside. The burning lemon peels will release a scent that is appealing to Osis.</li></ul><ul id="98444ce4-7884-4085-9978-73d3b0910186" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">You must rub lemon juice all over your afflicted daughter’s body daily. She will not bathe or shower until she is cured.</li></ul><ul id="7bf5aec1-a65f-4e33-8593-e51dcacfc69b" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Every day at midnight, recite this prayer to your daughter (it proceeded to show a string of nonsense words that I cannot remember now that ten years has passed).</li></ul><p id="ab9e1e0f-a10d-4a6c-93a5-7ed2216f0db0" class="">On the back of the letter was a list of people who were supposedly cured by the miracle of Osis. They included pictures and several first-hand accounts of the treatment working.</p><p id="b23cf9f6-2ef4-4ffe-a1d6-2646a9ca8e0d" class="">The painting depicted Osis as a tall and well-groomed man. He had pale skin and wore white robes. There was a halo around his head and he seemed to be glowing. He looked godly. The painting was very realistic. It did not resemble the style of any other cultural or religious art but it was masterfully crafted.</p><p id="a59be818-32c5-417a-b993-2ff08e02f8f1" class="">However, I also felt an evil undercurrent to our supposed saviour. His eyes bulged out and they had sickly yellow scleras that gave me a predatory impression, similar to a starved animal. His pupils were horizontal and rectangular, much like a goat. His mouth was closed and the corners of his lips tilted slightly upwards, forming a malicious smile. Also, he was standing in the middle of a burning forest.</p><p id="9afb34d4-06de-4697-84e8-8d335c38ce4b" class="">Although I was disturbed by this whole scenario, my mom was blinded by the promise of saving Cass. She got to work immediately by lighting the candles and flipping the main circuit breaker of our house. She placed the painting on a table next to Cass’s bed and peeled the lemons and squeezed their juice into a container.</p><p id="49dd5569-19bc-4a59-9284-94763b7011a6" class="">From that point on my mom would keep lemon peels burning in the fireplace and rub the juice on Cass every night. She would also recite the strange prayer to her as instructed. The windows were boarded up to prevent natural sunlight from entering to ensure that the house was lit by candle light only.</p><p id="41e16516-bd6a-41b0-8b99-a8587e3654b6" class="">We lived in a relatively rural area with no neighbours around for a few kilometers. This meant that there was nobody that could see the state that our house was in, so nobody would help my family out.</p><p id="9319dae6-ded6-40e3-87ae-b4eaeec12303" class="">“Don’t tell anyone at school about our situation,” my mom advised. “They might try and stop us from giving Cass the treatment she needs. You want Cass to get better don’t you Robin?”</p><p id="6a0e6977-4e26-4245-9223-990f44139176" class="">I did. So I stayed silent.</p><p id="1ba573ae-4402-44cc-ac8d-a6f015af07ad" class="">We consistently received new candles and lemons in the mail, causing the house to constantly smell like lemons and smoke. No electricity meant no air conditioning, so the house became hot and claustrophobic and musty. The candles were dim and flickering. They were headache-inducing and they hurt my eyes. Our house had become an altar to Osis.</p><p id="c25354cb-e765-4252-9773-238ae3cdcba5" class="">Needless to say, I got sick of the place. It gave me an evil sensation and I wanted to stay away from it. I resorted to spending most of my time outdoors.</p><p id="d87f949d-9b87-47ec-8704-d5706482446c" class="">We were situated near a heavily wooded area that I would explore every day after returning from school. I did not have any friends at school because I was quite antisocial, so I would play alone in the woods all day and return home at dinner.</p><p id="da04197f-8386-4329-9484-5b8267e293e2" class="">Since we had to turn off the electricity to our house, my mom used a battery-powered camping stove to cook instant noodles for us every night. I couldn’t play video games or browse the internet because the electricity in our house was turned off. But I didn’t mind because wandering the woods took my mind off the atrocious condition of the house.</p><p id="9bc1583e-5946-44db-86f4-33985cf090a9" class="">My mom would stay inside during the day to take care of Cass. After having dinner and performing the nightly ritual, mom would put me and Cass to bed then go work her night job as a gas station cashier. I was responsible for attending to Cass’s needs during the night.</p><p id="fe169e18-1369-4e15-b9a1-bd6fe14e1793" class="">After a few days of this routine, Cass complained about rashes all over her body from the lemon juice. She also complained that the painting of Osis scared her.</p><p id="944b6827-6ba8-4178-a5f7-65b7542abc1b" class="">My mom phoned the mysterious person who had initially offered her this healing regimen. She asked him why Cass was experiencing these issues.</p><p id="bdb6fdfe-474d-401d-b938-9cc65a3678fc" class="">The mysterious person assured her that the rashes were a side effect of the treatment and that they would disappear when she was cured by Osis. They also insisted that my mom should not fear Osis for he will be the one to save Cass, and that she must show complete devotion to him and continue the treatment. My mom believed them.</p><p id="506089bb-999e-4708-b6e0-6230c78a2227" class="">As the days passed, Cass’s condition worsened. The nausea head pain she experienced was severe, she could barely move and she was constantly slipping in and out of consciousness. One night at about midnight she woke me up with a bone-chilling scream from her room.</p><p id="df123c42-f301-46aa-96d2-9ab22316701d" class="">I was the one responsible for her needs during the night. I got up and rushed to her room to find her awake and staring at the painting of Osis in horror.</p><p id="3e66b5e0-0ddb-4d31-9672-ac3388051b63" class="">“What’s the matter?” I asked. She did nothing but point at the painting in shock.</p><p id="1635168a-c0e9-4ce3-b4c2-89a5e08edc3d" class="">I walked over to her and hugged her, ignoring the sickening smell of lemons coming from her skin. The painting looked the same as always. I thought perhaps she had a nightmare.</p><p id="8c13f4c2-b47b-4c77-99a5-57752a6aeeb9" class="">“I’m here for you Cass. Do you need anything?” She did not take her eyes off of Osis.</p><p id="90a1c962-691c-4871-99fe-17420e2ef172" class="">“Robin the picture talked to me.”</p><p id="28003c9b-df96-4f2c-a49c-bcf974165b9a" class="">“What?” Cass finally looked away from the painting and towards me.</p><p id="462da242-96f5-4f47-93a1-fe560566c3e6" class="">“The picture talked to me,” she repeated.</p><p id="f61a46d1-0bfe-446c-9a45-54fcd1d7c1df" class="">“What did it say?”</p><p id="b65dc397-a794-483f-8f95-a43addc89111" class="">“I don’t know. He was talking gibberish.” <em>He was talking gibberish? </em>I was certain she had experienced a nightmare or hallucinated it. She had a brain tumour, after all.</p><p id="1d5056d6-1850-4648-b1bf-930e2048814e" class="">“You’ll be okay Cass. It was all in your imagination,” I assured her. “Do you need water?”</p><p id="e9840cda-06ab-4991-8698-9d338366e2ae" class="">“Yes please.” I got her a glass of water and stayed with her until she fell back asleep.</p><p id="ee470865-56bb-4cc4-b352-c50bd5631bfe" class="">When I told my mom what Cass had said about the painting, she was ecstatic.</p><p id="bd0a56f9-06dd-4528-8660-0b41f82cec6b" class="">“I had a feeling my devotion and sacrifice would pay off! Cass is going to get all better thanks to Osis!” She was taking this as a sign that the treatment was working. This whole ordeal had creeped me the hell out. But nothing could have prepared me for what was to come.</p><p id="db71e51c-23da-4410-94d2-77bb7dbfd1f9" class="">After about four months into the treatment, something strange happened. Cass started to actually get better. At first she stopped complaining about her rashes. Then some movement returned to her body, and she could perform basic tasks once again. The tumour at the back of her head was visibly getting smaller, and eventually she said that she was no longer experiencing nausea and head pain. It was a miracle.</p><p id="92777485-c509-448a-88af-900f228a4412" class="">The three of us were overjoyed by this momentous reversal. This meant that Cass would stay alive, and we could potentially see her grow up to live a long happy life. It brought me to tears. I had nothing but gratitude for Osis and the joy he had enkindled in our lives.</p><p id="e979da2b-134b-497e-b4e1-70b1a64d9e96" class="">However, there was something strange about Cass. Don’t get me wrong, she acted like her old self and she was lively and joyful. But she insisted on staying indoors and keeping the windows boarded up. She did not want electric lights either. Just candles. She also wanted to keep the house smelling like lemons and she asked my mom to continue rubbing lemon juice on her.</p><p id="6c22953f-5faf-44c6-9fa1-a17f58e21e35" class="">“I like the smell.”</p><p id="86ed47f5-ff94-4879-ba8e-40b9bf513f51" class="">My mom phoned the mysterious person again to ask him about Cass’s strange behaviour. They responded by telling her that this was part of the treatment and we should do as Cass wishes until she is completely cured.</p><p id="83c06c4d-bf4f-47d6-9264-7a5d5ed821fe" class="">And so we did. A few weeks passed of us continuing to live essentially the same life. It was a small price to pay for the life of my sister. Every time I brought up how strange this situation was to my mom, she replied with:</p><p id="0c1f4148-bf06-408d-a74c-2484a4206718" class="">“It’s all just a side effect of the spiritual healing. Just leave Cass be. Everything will be okay in the end.” And I believed her.</p><p id="d954b072-ae92-4360-9ce8-36f1140f8cd6" class="">That’s when it started to happen.</p><p id="ee473df8-c4bd-416f-9b0a-702c81a11fdf" class="">I was woken up at about 3 am by a sound coming from Cass’s room. My room was right next to hers so I could easily pick up any noise, even if it was subtle. I was a light sleeper and this happened often so I was not surprised. But when I listened closely to what I was hearing, I got unsettled.</p><p id="4330ccae-a4c2-466b-8711-90a23a2a49f0" class="">I heard the voice of a man. It was garbled and extremely deep. I tried to listen to what he was saying, but I couldn’t make out any words. It sounded almost like a backwards recording of someone, drenched in vocal effects. It sounded evil and satanic and it terrified me. Was this what Cass meant by the painting speaking gibberish? <em>She wasn’t hallucinating?</em></p><p id="a5c614e3-4cec-4928-ab3e-5569be391b08" class="">A pit of dread formed in my stomach. I wished I could just go back to sleep and pretend like this never happened. But I knew that I had to investigate it, for my sister’s sake.</p><p id="eeb32f38-994e-4b78-b970-4a2a181b7cbe" class="">I slowly got off my bed and crept across my room, making sure I was completely silent. I carefully opened the door to my room, just enough for me to fit through. Then I took a step into the hallway. The voice was even louder now. Somehow, I willed myself to walk down the hall. The door to Cass’s room was directly to my right. I turned to face her door and put my hand on the doorknob. Then I stopped.</p><p id="633e2e7f-63b1-480f-81f6-7a5ba1d61d74" class="">My instincts were screaming at me not to open the door. So instead of turning the doorknob, I decided to bend down and look through the peephole. My blood ran cold.</p><p id="5305333a-46e4-458f-b573-41202e457b12" class="">The demonic voice was not coming from the painting of Osis. It was coming from Cass. She was awake and sitting up wide-eyed, looking off into space. Her entire body was still, except her jaw which flapped open and shut erratically as the evil noise escaped her mouth. The most unsettling part of this scene were her eyes. Her scleras were a nauseating shade of yellow. Her eyeballs bulged out and they had horizontal rectangular goat-like pupils. Identical to the painting of Osis.</p><p id="6b07d08b-d388-427b-b767-1164b2191d16" class="">I let out a panicked breath. Perhaps it was too loud because Cass (or whatever was possessing her) rolled her head towards the door, and looked straight at me.</p><p id="3d1f2e7d-dd61-49b7-8c5c-0804333d725b" class="">I ducked down under the peephole and stealthily slinked back into my room and onto my bed, pretending not to have seen anything. I don’t think that thing saw me, but I pretended to sleep under my covers just in case it did. Miraculously, I was able to fall asleep after about twenty minutes of listening to garbled unholy nonsense.</p><p id="8882955c-e4e2-46bf-8836-6ef1b09efc35" class="">The next day I woke up and went to school, as usual. I tried so hard not to think about the events that had transpired last night. I hoped that it had all just been a nightmare. After all, the past few months had been so stressful and emotionally taxing for me. It was natural to have nightmares. But deep down, I knew what I had witnessed last night was very real. And I could not focus on anything else for the entire day.</p><p id="20b1fb86-67c7-41fe-b2cd-149daf0ed8cf" class="">When I came home that afternoon, I dropped off my things, greeted my mom, and left to go play alone in the woods as usual. I needed time alone to process what I had seen and what I should do next. I did not know if what I saw last night was a side effect of the spiritual treatment. Was it even a cause for concern? Was Cass possessed? These questions raced through my mind as I wandered the familiar winding dirt paths of the forest. I decided that the best course of action was to confront Cass herself.</p><p id="31f057bb-1ff2-4fe1-8bac-489a20249205" class="">After I came home the three of us ate dinner together. Cass was acting like her usual self, talking non-stop. She seemed so innocent and sweet, but I could not shake the feeling that there was something sinister deep inside her. After dinner and Cass’s nightly ritual, I went straight to her room.</p><p id="61f786d3-7a84-4d4d-b7bc-36bc026ddc30" class="">“Hi Robin. What’s up?”</p><p id="e2ad99c8-bb2a-4d20-b57b-0b57aed3b93a" class="">“Nothing much. I heard some noises coming from your room last night. I was worried so I thought I would check on you to see how you’re doing. Did you have another bad dream?” Her eyes widened in fear and she looked straight at me.</p><p id="4bdb00f5-b473-484e-ae54-7660a7c6a604" class="">“Yes. I had another nightmare yesterday,” she responded tentatively. Her voice was shaking and weak. I walked over and sat beside her on the bed to comfort her.</p><p id="7edc8947-c725-49b7-b663-81c06a43e1f2" class="">“It’s okay Cass. It’s normal. I have nightmares too. What happened in your dream? I think telling me about it will help you feel better.”</p><p id="f67eda48-124d-4de9-bb9f-57d8d6c3de15" class="">“I had a dream that the painting guy was in jail. And he was scary. Actually, I’ve been having this nightmare for a long time.” Cass’s voice broke and she began to cry. I hugged her.</p><p id="f521265b-6e7f-4f82-a24a-ee7c54186aa5" class="">“You’re going to be okay Cass. I’m here for you. So you were standing in front of the scary guy’s jail cell?”</p><p id="81aa4ee2-527e-41b3-ace1-26a010cb2019" class="">“Yeah. He was really really skinny and he looked hungry. He is spitting lemon juice on the iron bars every day to melt them. He talks to me in gibberish. But I understand what he says. He said he didn’t have anything to eat for a thousand years, and that my family smelled really delicious and he can’t wait to feast when he gets out of jail. He spits on the bars every night. They are almost broken. He said that he will be free very soon.”</p><p id="81b1b016-0bd2-46bc-b2a1-4e9d028cec30" class="">This was a lot to take in. I knew I had to tell mom. But I couldn’t let Cass know what I had witnessed last night. It would have been too traumatic for her.</p><p id="18d1bb75-524c-444a-bff5-989169161a2d" class="">“Cass, can I ask you something?”</p><p id="f2ff726d-4b41-4831-8041-97c5005f071c" class="">“Yes?”</p><p id="79710b53-f8e6-4525-b9d6-a60f7c712c02" class="">“How come you like the smell of lemons? You said to keep the lemon peels burning all over the house, and you still want mom to keep rubbing lemons on your skin. Even though you’re all healed!”</p><p id="1b7ef4d2-2117-4770-a676-b0812ff147bf" class="">“If I don’t smell like lemons, the painting guy will get mad. And I will die.”</p><p id="b8fc25a2-b912-45c5-812f-e2a5d2abeb50" class="">“And what about light? Does the painting guy only like candle light?”</p><p id="ccf96cd6-34ab-4fc3-b95b-d5b34142aac7" class="">“Yeah. Lightbulbs and sunlight hurt him.”</p><p id="56ee27b9-57a0-4391-8415-af9137adc302" class="">I took out a flashlight I had brought in the room with me for this very purpose.</p><p id="f8ee4cc2-b03e-4bf1-8d4c-89198845e8d4" class="">“If I shine this light on you, will it hurt him?”</p><p id="81d2061a-8e48-4854-b63c-07da43b6efe2" class="">“Yes, he will burn. But so will I.”</p><p id="70a85cac-55c0-45fe-a3d6-892e84e38462" class="">“Thanks for the information, Cass. And don’t worry about the nightmares. They are all in your head. None of it is real. The painting guy will go away and you’re gonna get better soon. Everything will be okay in the end, I’m sure.”</p><p id="f2e73eb2-556e-4efd-83fb-a392b6363ad7" class="">But I wasn’t sure. I had a sinking feeling that something terrible was coming. I didn’t know what to do.</p><p id="e62babff-f56c-4510-9609-b8493ae3c018" class="">I left Cass’s room and tucked the flashlight in my drawer. Then I made my way towards the living room, where my mom was getting ready to leave for work. I told her everything about Cass’s dream, my conversation with her, and what I had witnessed last night. She did not take me seriously.</p><p id="b1119ac1-4c30-42c4-a7a5-4c0fe29b1111" class="">“Robin! I keep telling you this is all a side effect of the spiritual healing. Cass’s nightmare was just that. A nightmare. There is absolutely nothing to be scared of. Osis is our saviour.”</p><p id="127d6d23-4fff-465a-aed5-9387e365c3c2" class="">“But mom, there is something-”</p><p id="d5b0b573-f252-4256-a799-025b64ea6aa3" class="">“No buts! I’m tired of your disrespect. You should be more grateful to the one that saved your sister’s life. If you keep behaving this way I’m going to have no choice but to punish you. I need to leave for work now. Go back to your room and go to sleep. If Cass has another nightmare leave her be.”</p><p id="ee4f92cb-d189-4783-9087-614980d1f2ce" class="">I could not believe what I just heard. My mom was all that I had, and now it felt like she had abandoned me and Cass. I trudged back to my room and went to sleep. That night I woke up once again to the same demonic voice I had heard the night prior, coming from Cass’s room. I didn’t get up and investigate it. I just tucked my head under my pillow and cried.</p><p id="26a676e9-a16a-4661-a330-3053d62925e9" class="">I woke up the next morning and came up with a game plan. I knew that at some point Osis would break free from his jail cell and try to eat us. Once he presented himself, I planned on taking out my flashlight and shining it at him. If electric light burns him then I would be able to protect my family and run away.</p><p id="2a47c1c1-5602-4cc5-b6e4-6c32d9755195" class="">It was Saturday so there was no school that day. I stayed in my room all day, finished my homework and got lost in some novel that I had taken home from the school library. I kept my flashlight by my side.</p><p id="07d347c6-c066-46f9-8116-387552227b02" class="">We had lunch and dinner in peace. I noticed that Cass was not behaving like her usual self. Ordinarily she was chatty and bubbly, but that day she seemed apprehensive and melancholy, almost mournful.</p><p id="af751b8f-278c-45dc-accf-3375374d8bff" class="">After dinner, my mom went with Cass to her room and she performed her nightly ritual, as usual. I went to the bathroom to take a shower, leaving my flashlight on the bathroom counter. I let the hot water pour down my face and body, unclogging my pores and relaxing my muscles. I felt temporarily relieved of the constant stress of my insane every day life.</p><p id="96e504c5-37b1-4c3e-acac-5cdc514ea258" class="">I finished showering and brushing my teeth and went to my room to change into my pyjamas. I planned on finishing that novel before going to sleep that night to take my mind off the insanity of what was happening in the room next to mine.</p><p id="5a2007d8-e144-43b9-8586-639d34a77399" class="">Just as I got comfortable in my bed with my book, I realized something was wrong. I had left my flashlight in the bathroom.</p><p id="82a114c5-a43e-46e7-8643-d26567abbdfb" class="">I rose from my bed and paced out of my room and down the hall, mildly alarmed. When I opened the bathroom door my nose was bombarded with the powerful, nauseating scent of lemon juice. It was so sour and acidic that it stung my nasal passages, my eyes welled up and I could feel burning in my throat.</p><p id="a72ce65b-19aa-4a46-a1d4-d440e6c2a6cd" class="">I identified the source of a scent as the flashlight I had left on the bathroom counter. It seemed to be disfigured and corroded and soaked in some sort of acid. Or lemon juice. Lemon juice? Iron bars? I grabbed the flashlight off the counter, ignoring the burning sensation it inflicted on my fingers. I tried to turn it on. It didn’t work.</p><p id="1b895cc5-c01d-4dc1-bbd6-11b32b0f40db" class="">A deep and visceral feeling of dread rose from the bottom of my stomach. Maybe it was because of the acid or maybe it was because of the implications of the situation, but I began to cry and sweat.</p><p id="a4ddcbef-aeda-4aaa-ac2a-9f3bfd329626" class="">Just then, I heard an ear-shattering scream from down the hall, in Cass’s room. My mom was in Cass&#x27;s room performing the ritual. <em>It had my mom</em>.</p><p id="7c469c5b-f7e0-46ee-b528-69dd2ae5ed69" class="">I carefully peeked my head outside of the bathroom door and looked down the hall and into Cass’s room. I could make out my little sister, bent over and covered in blood. She was ravenously stuffing her mouth with bits from the large gaping opening in my mom’s limp and sanguinary body.</p><p id="b97316cf-48e0-4af6-8d9a-a5d1e2fe4536" class="">Trying my best to avoid breaking down into tears or vomiting my dinner down the toilet, I collected my thoughts and planned my next move. I knew that Osis was in total possession of Cass’s body. I also knew that he would be coming after me after he was done with my mom. Since the flashlight was broken, my only option was to escape the house and run away as far as possible. My best bet was to run into the woods behind the house. Since I wandered those woods every day, I knew them like the back of my hand.</p><p id="8e524005-845a-4f89-9ed9-648b74bf5ed7" class="">I crept out of the bathroom and across the living room and the kitchen to where the back door was. I unlocked the door, turned the knob and slowly pushed it open, trying to make as little noise as possible. It was almost pitch-black outside. After stepping out, I closed the door behind me and immediately ran into the thick line of trees. I don’t think it saw or heard me.</p><p id="d44118b0-1a53-4fef-9c08-7baa5f7875ca" class="">There were countless places I could hide, but I figured the best place to go was towards my closest neighbour. It would take about seven minutes of running in the woods to reach there. I did not waste any time and sprinted in the direction I knew I needed to go.</p><p id="f42c55f6-295e-4fbd-aa45-df6d48dd1a20" class="">The ground was rough and covered in sticks and pebbles which cut and bruised my bare feet. It was cold and dark. Tree branches whipped my face and body as I ran between the trees, covering me in cuts and bruises.</p><p id="38bcd421-130a-4c67-bbe3-091de4517c2d" class="">After a few minutes of running, I was mentally and physically fatigued. Under the impression that I was safe, I slowed my pace to a brisk walk in an attempt to catch my breath. It was then that I heard the sound of crunching leaves behind me. It was a very quiet and subtle sound but I knew from the pacing of the sound that it was not an animal or the wind. I thought hard and scanned my mental image of the area to find a place to hide.</p><p id="aa5ae181-10af-4b18-8005-0b2052a7fcf5" class="">The only place I could think of was a small cave opening a few meters to my left. I remember I had taken shelter there once during a rainstorm. I beelined towards the opening and dove into the hole. It was just large enough for me to fit. As I adjusted myself to my surroundings, I realized that I needed to block the entrance to the cave. I tried to push a boulder towards the entrance of the cave. It was heavier than I thought, but I channelled all of my strength into it and managed to roll it onto its side in a way that blocked Osis from entering.</p><p id="39c0da87-dda2-47d3-941d-c4a6d59ba68e" class="">Just as I was about to catch my breath again, I heard a steady steaming noise coming from behind the boulder. I sat in the pitch black cave in terror for about a minute until the smell hit my nose, and I realized what was happening on the other side of the cave entrance. It was the same nauseating smell of lemons that permeated from the destroyed flashlight. Was Osis spitting acid on the rock in an attempt to corrode it so he could reach me?</p><p id="f51cf36d-9552-47cd-84c7-a3d8fcb93626" class="">My mind raced as I thought of every potential escape plan. I knew there was another opening deeper in the cave that I could use to escape. However, it led in the opposite direction that I wanted to go, and it was an area that I hadn’t explored much. What if I got lost somewhere in the cave, and Osis broke in and found me? And even if I did escape the cave, would Osis still be able to smell me and track me down?</p><p id="be6142b4-328e-450e-b95a-3fa9ae66bb80" class="">I sat in the darkness of the cave for about five minutes, petrified that at any time the boulder would melt away and Osis would burst through. Somehow I managed to gather my thoughts and formulate the plan that gave me the greatest chance for survival. I had to find the other cave opening and escape.</p><p id="7c1aafa6-cbde-4996-bdb1-18afb72b7e68" class="">But before that, I took off my pyjamas and threw them on the ground. This way, Osis would not notice that I ran away because the scent of my clothes would give the impression that I was still in the cave.</p><p id="f9c9a336-0acf-4db1-8ec3-895ef1a3bd1f" class="">I ran through a suffocating network of tunnels in pitch dark, trying to remember which path led to the other opening of the cave. The air was damp and musty and cold. I was especially uncomfortable because I was wearing nothing but underwear. Every dead end that I ran into struck fear and hopelessness in my heart. The longer I spent in the cave, the narrower the walls got, and the harder it was to breathe.</p><p id="f1bae145-f696-411b-9e6f-729e9e396b32" class="">After encountering a dead end for the fourth or fifth time, I began to lose hope that I would ever find my way out. Osis was either almost done corroding the entrance of the cave, or he was already in the cave, chasing after me.</p><p id="b926ebaa-8a13-4089-b847-01538d8bf42e" class="">My lungs were stifled, my body was weak and I had so many cuts on my feet that I left a trail of blood wherever I went. I had no idea where I was. The realization that my mother was dead settled in and I broke down and began to weep hopelessly. My family was dead and I had no one else. I felt like collapsing of the cave floor and waiting for my impending death.</p><p id="1a392967-20f4-4bde-bd28-53ee51c28956" class="">But something inside me impelled me to keep searching. All I could think was if I gave up, it would be a betrayal to my family. I needed to keep on trying to survive until the very end. If I ever made it out alive, I would live my life to the fullest for my mom and Cass. They deserved to experience everything that life had to offer through my eyes.</p><p id="e991c1c8-5899-4d1d-b1cd-5e1362cddf46" class="">I turned back around and wearily plodded down a path that I thought I hadn’t travelled yet. After a few turns, I saw something in the distance. I could barely make out a tree. I had found the other exit. With a burst of energy, I stumbled towards the opening and squirmed my way out of the cave.</p><p id="91bb1b79-dfd6-41de-824d-6ff95aa4859b" class="">I continued to limp across the forest. I had no idea where I was. I could not think and I could hardly move, but I kept trudging straight forward.</p><p id="0d548d70-821a-463f-83da-59a2348115c8" class="">I don’t know how long I spent limping in that forest. I must have fallen unconscious at some point because the only thing I remember afterwards was waking up on the ground. I was physically impaired. I could not move my legs or my feet. They felt numb. I was freezing and in unbearable pain.</p><p id="0bad6ab3-216d-4eef-9d61-2f4c31924977" class="">I recall lying in that spot for an extended period of time. I must have spent the whole night there because the sun began to rise and peek out from behind some of the trees. It was then that I noticed something in the distance prowling towards me and at high speed. It was my sister. Or rather it was Osis, possessing my sister’s body. It was hissing in the same demonic language that I had heard the night before.</p><p id="e2ac673b-4211-4589-877f-c9bbb172342b" class="">I accepted my death. There was no way that I could escape now. I had tried my best to survive, to the point of physical incapacity. My family would be proud.</p><p id="23eaf0a7-2746-445b-aa60-be6169e9f7da" class="">But if I died then, I wouldn’t be alive recounting this event. Apparently, Osis had forgotten one crucial element. It had a weakness to the sun.</p><p id="9f9413de-c27d-4c84-931d-96158926183e" class="">As it crawled towards me, a beam of sunlight from between the trees fell across its face. Instantly, it grimaced and screamed and writhed around violently. The skin on its face burned and his flesh started to melt. The burns spread rapidly across its body, then its body burst in a spectacular explosion, setting the surrounding trees on fire. I passed out.</p><p id="5bea1c68-0577-41cc-a31c-5954e2adef69" class="">I woke up in a hospital room a few days later. I was in great pain and I had several first and second degree burns all over my body. My feet and legs were in bad shape as well, after running in the woods for so long.</p><p id="67a11d42-cd51-4a06-adc8-8824b7343ec7" class="">It took me just a few months to recover from my physical injuries. However, the trauma was unbearable. My life was a living hell for the next few years as I came to terms with what happened to my family. I was taken in by my grandparents on the other side of the country and I attended therapy sessions for several years to help me cope with the trauma.</p><p id="146112a9-e2a9-4285-9664-5fc59a0d75ca" class="">I was told that the woods had caught fire and it spread to our area, setting our house ablaze. My mom’s remains were found inside the house, charred and missing several internal organs. My body was found a few kilometers away in the woods. My sister’s body was never found.</p><p id="3739021a-934d-4d6d-90e8-9132a7acd6b1" class="">This was apparently what the local authorities assumed happened. I don’t blame them as it was the most logical conclusion. But I know the truth. And now you do too.</p><p id="f59cf822-499d-42ef-ac9b-d3fb53564b7f" class="">It has now been ten years since these events took place, and they haunt my nightmares to this day. If you take away anything from this story, let it be this: If you or one of your loved ones are ever diagnosed with cancer, no matter how desperate you may be, stay away from sketchy alternative treatment methods.</p><p id="640a63a4-2bf5-45ee-910f-3448f71ed846" class="">___________________________________________________________________________________</p><p id="9ac152db-077a-42d2-be5c-79588720d314" class=""><mark class="highlight-purple_background">Back to okhan.me:</mark></p><figure id="25a52e57-2f67-4d7f-914c-6d96ddefdd52"><a href="http://okhan.me" class="bookmark source"><div class="bookmark-info"><div class="bookmark-text"><div class="bookmark-title">Omar&#x27;s Portfolio</div></div><div class="bookmark-href"><img src="https://okhan.me/Favicon.ico?v=2" class="icon bookmark-icon"/>http://okhan.me</div></div></a></figure><p id="8866e8ba-c881-4777-a568-919386c6166e" class="">
