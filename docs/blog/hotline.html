</style></head><body><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ultranationalist embrace of brutality (a critical analysis of Hotline Miami)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In this textual analysis, I will argue that Hotline Miami criticizes ultranationalism by portraying it as a violent force which causes people to dehumanize their political opponents to the point that committing acts of violence towards them becomes an enjoyable activity. It does this through the somewhat elusive story of it’s protagonist, as well as it’s immersive gameplay and narrative design. As such, this analysis will take on a combination of the ludological approach and the narrative approach to game analysis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Section 1: Hotline Miami’s narrative design</h1><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In this section, I will discuss how Hotline Miami’s narrative design mirrors how ultranationalists, specifically authority figures, dismiss the rationale and emotional weight of killing political enemies. The lore of Hotline Miami is politically driven. When playing through the game in a normal playthrough however, without actively searching for secrets, the backstory of the game is not immediately clear. The player does not know who is behind the phone calls instructing the protagonist to commit mass murder, as it is never revealed on a casual playthrough. The reason for this is that during times of political turmoil, citizens of a country are often told by their government that certain groups of people are evil. The explanation that authority figures generally provide is that those groups are of a different nationality or ethnicity, and that they are harming their country. Since most people trust in their government and other authority figures, they do not seek out any further explanation; the simple premise that they are evil because they are on the other side of a conflict is enough motivation to get people to kill them. In the final level of the game, the player finds the people responsible for the phone calls, shown to be dressed as janitors. The janitors mock the player for not already knowing the reason behind all the killings, and they seem to insinuate that the killings were meaningless, as if killing people does not carry any emotional weight at all and that it is just a normal thing that happens all the time. This scene draws further parallels to the psychology of political turmoil. Soldiers rarely question why they are expected to kill their political enemies in times of war, because the answer is seemingly simple. That being, they are “the enemy” and you must kill them, period.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This dehumanizes the enemy and dismisses the emotional weight associated with killing them, just as the janitors dismiss the emotional weight of the player killing all of those people in-game. To conclude this section, Hotline Miami’s narrative design is very purposeful as it attempts to communicate how ultranationalists dismiss both the rationale and the emotional weight of killing other people.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">

    Section 2: The protagonist’s story</h1><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The previous section covered Hotline Miami’s narrative design which is less about the actual story and more about how the game conveys it’s story to the player. In this section, I will discuss the story of the game’s protagonist, and evidence that suggests he is willingly complying with authority in his killing of Russians as an act of revenge-fuelled nationalism. In the secret ending of the game, it is revealed that the phone calls received by the protagonist are coming from an American ultra-nationalist organization called “50 Blessings” with the goal of damaging</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Russo-American relations. All the killings done by the protagonist throughout the game are against agents of the Russian mafia. Furthermore, there is evidence that the protagonist has specifically dehumanized Russians because of a personal resentment that he holds against them. The first piece of evidence is shown at the end of the introductory level in the game.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">During the level, the protagonist is instructed to kill many Russian agents to retrieve a briefcase, then dispose of it. The protagonist has no trouble killing all of the Russians in the targeted building. However, when he goes to an alleyway to dispose of the briefcase, he kills a homeless person on his way out before immediately vomiting out of disgust. This is evidence that he is specifically desensitized towards killing Russians. The second game in the Hotline Miami franchise provides more context as to why this is the case. In Hotline Miami 2, the protagonist is revealed to have fought in the Russo-American war which took place four years before the events of the first game. As discussed in the previous section, soldiers during times of war are trained to dehumanize political opponents to remove any emotional weight associated with killing them. It is for this reason that the protagonist of the game does not react negatively to killing Russians. Hotline Miami 2 also provides evidence that the protagonist willingly complies with 50 Blessing’s phone calls because he exhibits a personal hatred towards Russians. In the sequel, the protagonist’s friend, Beard, saved his life while serving with him in the military. Later, he is killed in a Russian attack on San Francisco, an atomic blast. Throughout the first half of Hotline Miami 1, we can see that the protagonist never recovered from the trauma of his close friend’s death. Beard frequently appears in the protagonist’s coma dreams, and is always portrayed in a positive light. It is natural that the protagonist would feel an intense hatred towards Russians after their country’s attack killed the man who saved his life. This hatred manifests as a desire for revenge, which in combination with the previously discussed dehumanization of Russians by the protagonist, is what leads the protagonist to willingly comply with 50 Blessing’s call for violence. In fact, not only does the protagonist comply with all of their orders, but he also deeply enjoys the experience of killing the Russians at each of the targeted locations. This is discussed further in the following section.</p>

    <h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Section 3: Hotline Miami’s gameplay design</h1><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In this section, I will discuss the design elements of Hotline Miami’s gameplay which makes killing enemies an enjoyable activity for the player, and how it emulates the protagonist’s experience of ultra-nationalistic revenge killing. The game encourages players to grow comfortable with the idea of murdering a large number of people. It accomplishes this by putting the player in a flow state in which they repeatedly fail and retry levels. With each attempt, the layout of the environment and the details of each opponent becomes increasingly ingrained in their mind as they formulate and refine a strategy for their killing spree. Hotline Miami uses the flow state described above to emulate the protagonist’s desensitization to the emotional weight associated with killing. It is valuable to note that on a blind playthrough of Hotline Miami, the player does not know the protagonist’s backstory or political motivations. They are simply killing the enemies because the game tells them that they are enemies. This mirrors the psychology of ultranationalism discussed in the first section, where soldiers are told to kill political enemies simply because they are enemies. The music that plays during the levels also contributes to the player’s flow state. The songs that play are hypnotic and repetitive electronic jams and they make it easy for the player to slip into a trance-like state while killing enemies. The songs sound like they would play at a party or a rave of some sort instead of a violent event. This further desensitizes the player to violence by staging their horrific in-game actions alongside a fun and cool-sounding soundtrack. This leads into another important factor, which is that the protagonist is not only desensitized to killing Russians, but he actively enjoys it. The evidence for this is that the game makes it <i>fun </i>to kill enemies. One such way that it does this is by awarding the player with combos that flash on the screen whenever the player gets a kill streak (that is, killing multiple enemies in succession). This, along with other “bonuses”, increases the player’s score and results in a higher letter grade, shown at the end of the level. In other words, players are rewarded for brutality, which increases the fun factor while killing enemies in the game. Another way that the game makes it fun to kill enemies is simply how it <i>feels </i>to interact with them. Hitting an enemy with a bat or a door causes a crunchy “thud” sound and causes the enemy to slide across the floor like a ragdoll, which feels very satisfying. When an enemy is knocked out, the player can stand above them and “finish them off”, which can mean anything from strangling them to dismembering them with a chainsaw, but it all feels lighthearted and satisfying rather than horrific or violent. All of the aforementioned gameplay design choices come together to transform the mass-murder experience to something that is fun and satisfying. The reason the game does this is to emulate the experience of the protagonist, who enjoys killing Russians due</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">to the ultranationalism instilled within him from his military experience as well as the death of his friend Beard by Russian hands. The game puts the player in the protagonist’s shoes, and then in a famous cutscene, it asks the player if they enjoy killing people. This is to show that it is easy for anyone to become fuelled by nationalism and revenge to the point that they become desensitized to violence, and begin to enjoy killing people on the other side, treating violence and brutality as a game.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/>

    </p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</h1><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">In the first section, I explained how Hotline Miami’s narrative design communicates how ultranationalists dismiss the rationale and the emotional weight of killing their political opponents. In the next section, I explained the protagonist’s elusive story and gave evidence that he is an revenge-fuelled ultranationalist who has dehumanized Russians to the point that he does not feel the emotional impact of killing them. In the last section, I explained how Hotline Miami’s gameplay emulates the experience of the protagonist by turning brutal killing into a fun activity; evidence that the protagonist actively enjoys killing Russians. All of this evidence converges to the main idea that Hotline Miami is critical of ultranationalism because it shows the player, through a combination of story, narrative design and gameplay design, how ultranationalism promotes violence to the extent that one might enjoy hurting others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Works cited</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Fischbach, Mark Edward. <i>Hotline Miami: BLOODY GOOD FUN</i>. <i>YouTube</i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjXTgRoS4ps" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt;" target="_blank">, YouTube, 29 May 2014, </a><span style=" color: #1154CC; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 11pt;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjXTgRoS4ps</span>.
