I'm a student at the University of Calgary, currently in the third year of my journey to recieving an Honours BSc in Computer Science.

This past summer I was awarded the NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award to fund 4 months of summer research in the field of VR. I led the development of an embodied virtual guide in an immersive digital twin (replica) of a building on my university campus, made in the Unity game engine. I am currently conducting a related user study about spatial memory and route-learning. This project can be extended to evaluate the feasibility of VR evacuation training (e.g. virtual fire drills).

I recently joined the software team of an organization on my campus called CalgaryToSpace. This grants me the priviledge of getting to write embedded software for a satellite that is planned to launch into orbit in 2025.

I am also experienced in web development, android app development, and AR, the skills for which I acquired through my participation in several personal projects and collaborative hackathons. I am dedicated to academic excellence, and I pride myself on a desire to learn things deeply, hence my choice to step out of my comfort zone to take on challenging topics such as graphics programming, emdedded software development, and mixed reality.

As for my other hobbies, I'm a huge fishing enthusiast after my friend introduced me to it last summer, although I'm not very good ðŸ¥² (the photo below is my most successful catch). I also enjoy hiking, occasionally skiing, and working out on gynmastic rings.
